# Artemis - A Personal Productivity Assistant

## Overview

Artemis is a Python-based personal productivity assistant inspired by Jarvis from Iron Man. This project integrates with a Notion life tracker to help manage daily habits, tasks, and plans. The initial version is built with hardcoded logic to explore the limits of non-AI-based automation. Later, it will evolve into a more dynamic, AI-powered assistant.

## Key Features

### Integration with Notion:

- Connects to a Notion database to fetch tasks, habits, and plans.

- Uses the Notion API to retrieve, update, and manage life tracker data.

### Text-to-Speech (TTS):

- Converts tasks and schedules into spoken responses for a more interactive experience.

- Voice Commands:

- Listens for predefined commands to provide task summaries or other responses.

### Stepwise Development:

- Phase 1 (Current): Hardcoded logic to test the feasibility of task management using predefined commands.

- Phase 2 (Future): Enhanced AI capabilities for natural language understanding and dynamic conversation.
